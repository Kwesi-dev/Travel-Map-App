# Travel-Map-App
This project was built using Mern Stack.
The Travel Map App allows a user who is logged in to choose a location
on the map where he or she finds nice and interesting and then mark
it on the map.The user is then allowed to give the mark a name, description 
and also rate the place he or she selected. This is a very interesting app to try.
